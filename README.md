# COMP 330 Project 1 - Twitter Parser
I decided to approach this assignment by taking in people's inputs from console as the tweets. As the assignment progresses, I can probably make it read text files to parse through the tweets. I guess it depends on what is required because as of now it does see the mentions, hashtags, and websites!
