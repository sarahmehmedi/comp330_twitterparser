# COMP 330 Project 1 - Twitter Parser
##Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to help me learn how to do unit testing and become more aware of how to do it. I started this project with almost no hands on experience in unit testing. Another purpose is to learn about the importance of github and the idea of working on your code daily help make the quality of your code a lot better.

##My Approach
I decided to approach this assignment by taking in people's inputs from console as the tweets. As the assignment progresses, I can probably make it read text files to parse through the tweets. I guess it depends on what is required because as of now it does see the mentions, hashtags, and websites! The way I interpretted the requirements is to make something that would parse through the tweet and produce a list of mentions, hashtags, and websites. I also saw that we were required to commit to github a lot and also learn how to do unit tests. I see the requirement of using github to commit was a great practice of saving your work and doing commits daily really helped me see how to make my code better. 


##Futures Plans (?)
If the project progresses, I plan on making it into an application and parsing through JSON urls for the tweets. I could also try and incorporate Twitter API to make it better. It could also be shown onto a webpage and maybe that would make it more visually appealing.
